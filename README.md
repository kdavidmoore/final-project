# Final Project

This is my final project for the 16 Week Immersive Bootcamp at [DigitalCrafts](http://digitalcrafts.com).

## Features
* In progress...

* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
* AngularJS
* [AngularUI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

### Note:
You will need a public access token from Mapbox for the embedded map to work. Store your access token under assets/js/mapboxApi.js like so:
```javascript
const pubAccessToken = 'myPublicAccessTokenString';
```
When you create a Mapbox account, you will also need to go to the [Mapbox Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/classic/projects/) and create a new project. Store the project ID assets/js/mapboxApi.js:
```javascript
const projectId = 'myMapboxEditorProjectId';
```
