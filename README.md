# Ag Labs
This full-stack eCommerce app is my final project for the 16 Week Immersive Bootcamp at [DigitalCrafts](http://digitalcrafts.com). The app allows users to submit soil or water sample information to a Cooperative Extension service and electronically view (randomly generated) test results. It's basically a MEAN stack app, except I used MySQL as the database.

## Example / Usage
Upon visiting the [demo link](http://ag.kdavidmoore.com), the first thing to do is to register by clicking the "Register" link on the navbar (or the "Get Started" button on the splash page). Fill out the form with your sample information and click "Submit". Then you will be taken to the "Services" page, where you can start filling out an order form for your soil or water samples. When you are asked to enter credit card information, use `4242 4242 4242 4242` as the card number, any future date as the expiration date, and any three-digit number as the CVC. Once your order is complete and paid for, follow the link to "View the status of my orders" to see whether your test results are ready. Results for each "paid" order are randomly generated on the first view; for each subsequent view, the results are retrieved from the database.

## Getting Started
### Installing dependencies
After downloading the source code, open a terminal window and install the Node.js package dependencies:
```javascript
cd my-project-directory/server
npm install
```
Then run nodemon to start the Node.js server:
```javascript
nodemon
```

### Placing API keys and other constants
If you download the source code and attempt to run the app on your computer, you will need to create an account with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and obtain a public access token. Otherwise, the embedded maps will not work. Store your access token under `/app/constants/mapbox.constant.js` using the following format:
```javascript
const MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'my_public_access_token';
```
After obtaining your access token, go to the [Mapbox Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/classic/projects/) and create a new project. Store the project ID in /app/constants/mapbox.constant.js:
```javascript
const MAPBOX_PROJECT_ID = 'my_mapbox_editor_project_id';
```

Similarly, [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) requires a special API key, which can be stored as `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `/app/constants/google-maps.constant.js`.

Nodemailer will not work without a valid "from" email address and password. You can use Google, Yahoo, or another email provider, but you will most likely need to either use [OAuth2 authentication](https://nodemailer.com/using-gmail/) or modify your email account's security settings to allow "Less Secure" apps. Store your username and password in `/server/routes/secrets.js`, along with your Stripe key and MySQL login info:
```javascript
module.exports = {
	getSecrets: function() {
		return {
			STRIPE_KEY: 'my_stripe_test_key',
			DB_USER: 'my_mysql_username',
			DB_PASSWORD: 'my_mysql_password',
			FROM_ADDRESS: 'my_email_address',
			FROM_PASS: 'my_email_password'
		};
	}
};
```

Finally, the `API_KEY` constant should point to the host and port number that your Node.js server is running on. Store this constant in `/app/constants/api-url.constant.js`:
```javascript
const API_KEY = 'http://localhost:3090';
```

## Architecture
### Directory structure
```
app/	/* contains code loaded by the AngularJS app */
	components/	/* contains Angular components grouped by coupling, e.g., the map view goes with the map controller */
	config/	/* Angular config file goes here -- this is where routes are set up */
	constants/	/* API keys and such are stored here (not included in repo) */
	services/	/* custom Angular services are defined here */
	shared/	/* shared Angular components go here, e.g., the navbar view and navbar controller */
assets/	/* contains client-side code not related to the Angular app */
	css/	/* stylesheet generated by Compass is saved here */
	img/	/* images go here */
	libs/	/* third-party libraries not related to the core Angular app go here */
server/	/* contains the Express app, which serves as the API */
```

### Third party libraries/frameworks/modules
* Bootstrap 3 (requires jQuery)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* AngularJS v1.5.5
* [AngularUI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
* [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
* [Angular Chart](https://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/) (requires Chart.js)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* Node.js [driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) for MySQL
* Node.js [module](https://stripe.com/docs/libraries) for Stripe
* [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/)
* [bcrypt-nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs)
* [rand-token](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rand-token)

### Custom AngularJS services
* UserAuthService - makes an $http GET request to the Node server (i.e., the API) to make sure that the token stored in $cookies is also stored in the MySQL database.
* GetRequestService - provides functions that make $http GET requests to the the API and send back data to the controllers.
* PostRequestService - provides functions that make $http POST requests to the API and send back data to the controllers.
* GeocodingService - makes an $http GET request to Google Maps Geocoding API to look up the geographic coordinates of the sample address.
* ResultsService - sends order info to the API, which generates results for that order or sends back existing results; sends back results to the "results" controller.
* CancelService - sends the order number to be deleted to the API, which sends a "DELETE" query to MySQL.

### Detailed description of features
* User can register and log in.
* User login status is tracked using rand-token (which generates a 32-character alphanumeric token) and ngCookies (which stores the random token received from the API).
* Input fields validated using AngularJS.
* Error messages and services-forms load in nested views using AngularUI Routing.
* Form data are submitted to the API using custom AngularJS services that abstract the $http requests.
* Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt-nodejs before being stored in the database.
* Nodemailer sends the user a confirmation email when order is complete and paid for.
* User can view the status of each order (unpaid/paid) from the "View orders" page.
* User can view the location of their samples on a map using Google Maps Geocoding API + Leaflet + Mapbox.
* If the order status is "paid", the user can view results for each order using Angular Chart.
* Orders can be cancelled from the Payment page.
